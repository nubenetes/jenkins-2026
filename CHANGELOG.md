# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [v0.5.0] - 2026-06-14

### Observability & Grafana Cloud Integration
- **gcx CLI GitOps**: Refactored dashboard deployment to use the native `gcx` CLI (`gcx resources push`) instead of raw API calls.
  - Implemented automated `gcx login --yes` to discover stack ID and namespace.
  - Automatically wraps raw JSON dashboards into Kubernetes-style `apiVersion: dashboard.grafana.app/v1` manifests.
  - Pushes both Folders and Dashboards declaratively with `--include-managed`.
- **Private Data Source Connect (PDC)**: Implemented Grafana PDC for secure Jenkins datasource access from Grafana Cloud.
- **Jenkins Datasource**: Added automated provisioning of the Jenkins datasource via Terraform.
- **Dashboard Portability**: Removed hardcoded cloud datasource names to ensure dashboards are fully portable between OSS and Cloud modes.
- **OTel Configuration**: Ensured consistent resource attributes and robust dashboard queries across metrics and traces.

### Script & Deployment Performance
- **Smart Polling**: Replaced blocking `helm --wait` commands with active explicit `kubectl rollout status` checks, implementing smart polling for resource readiness.
- **Sequential Execution**: Optimized the deployment scripts to run major steps (like observability) sequentially to avoid SSA conflicts and reduce debug log noise.
- **Helm Rollbacks**: Replaced deprecated `helm --atomic` with `--rollback-on-failure`.
- **StatefulSet Monitoring**: Fixed readiness checks to monitor `statefulset/jenkins` instead of `deployment/jenkins`.

### Documentation
- Updated `README.md` with detailed instructions for the new PDC, `gcx`, and MCP features.
- Documented mandatory Grafana Cloud manual setup steps and necessary permissions for the Jenkins plugin.
- Clarified the required token scopes and datasource information.

### Fixes
- **Terraform**: Fixed Grafana provider configuration to resolve client initialization errors and ensure proper use of service account tokens for instance-level resources.
- **Helm SSA**: Resolved Helm Server-Side Apply (SSA) conflicts by pre-deleting the `otel-collector-gateway` ConfigMap during redeployments.
